### Streaming Applications with Akka Streams
**Abstract:** Streaming applications is a new category of Big Data applications which emphasizes support for non-hard real-time processing of information. It is important as the timeliness of data processing / analysis offers competitive advantage over competitors. This presentation will introduce streaming applications concepts, followed by a simple stream processing example with Akka Streams, demonstrating both linear processing and dataflow programming via GraphDSL.

### A Whirlwind Tour of Apache Mesos
**Abstract:** What if you can write applications and treat your entire datacenter as one giant pool of resources? Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

### .NET Actor Programming with Akka.NET
**Abstract:** Akka.NET is an open-source .NET port of the Akka actor programming toolkit and runtime from the JVM. The toolkit provides an abstraction layer to help programmers deal with the current challenges and optimise development for modern hardware and infrastructure: multi-core architecture, cloud infrastructure, and distributed computing.
