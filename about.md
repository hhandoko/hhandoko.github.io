I'm a software engineer based in Singapore. Focusing on web technologies, interested in distributed computing, concurrency, and the actor model.

I am part of the [Engineers.SG](https://engineers.sg/) community initiative, helping to record conferences and meetup events to make it accessible for all.

I help run the [Singapore Scala Programmers](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/) user group from 2017 to 2021.
