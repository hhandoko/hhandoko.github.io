I'm a software engineer based in Singapore. Focusing on web technologies, interested in distributed computing, concurrency, and the actor model.

In my spare time, I help run the [Singapore Scala Programmers](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/) user group and volunteer my time with the [Engineers.SG](https://engineers.sg/) community initiative.
