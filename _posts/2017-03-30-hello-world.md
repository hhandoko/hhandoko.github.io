So after almost two years ([and a bit of a nudge](https://twitter.com/scalawilliam/status/842505338809008128)) I finally gotten around to publish a blog.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you can skip the Jekyll and start with a plain index.html ;)</p>&mdash; William Narmontas (@ScalaWilliam) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScalaWilliam/status/842510741848576000">March 16, 2017</a></blockquote>

After all these times, I just came to a realisation that there is a practical need for one. <!--more--> Besides recording my thoughts and sharing some knowledge, I'm thinking of using it as a wiki to store:

- notes on development configuration (e.g. SBT plugins, desktop setup, etc.),
- links to useful articles and perhaps my thoughts on it, and
- tracking of side-projects and experimentations.

Stay tuned!
